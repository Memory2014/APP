This is the easiest way to connect computers, and the most similar to the Mac method below.   \n\nEnabling File Sharing in Mac \n\nTo set up file sharing on a Mac, go to System Preferences and navigate to the Sharing preference pane. \nCheck the box marked 'File Sharing' and ensure that your public folder is listed under the shared folders. \nIf you expect you'll need to share with any Windows computers, hit the Options button and mark the 'Share Files and Folders Using SMB' box, as well as the box below it that corresponds to your username.\nYou can place a file in your Public folder for them to view and copy.", nil);
